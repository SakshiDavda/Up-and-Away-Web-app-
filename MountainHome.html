Though it has taken a back seat to other types of hunting, the equipment used in the practice of archery has not been left behind with advances in technology.There are three main pieces of equipment necessary to practice archery. They are bows, arrows and a target. Though not a physical piece of equipment, the archer’s stance should also be considered a necessary part of archery.</p>
